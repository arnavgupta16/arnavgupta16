I'm Arnav Gupta, a multifaceted tech enthusiast majoring in Information Technology at the Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology. My programming prowess spans languages such as C++, C, and Python, and extends into the compelling domain of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) - a field I'm ardently engrossed in.

Data Structures, Algorithms, and competitive programming form the bedrock of my technical expertise, empowering me to tackle complex coding challenges with finesse. However, this is merely one aspect of my professional persona.

Embracing my extroverted nature, I derive energy from engaging with others. This has not only enhanced my public speaking capabilities but also inspired the creation of "Geek Room", a vibrant community of over 7000+ coding enthusiasts. Here, we exchange insights, learn collectively, and nurture our shared passion for technology. (Intrigued? I warmly invite you to join us!)

Stepping away from the digital world, my entrepreneurial journey has recently embarked with the co-founding of "Balmse", an early-stage startup aiming to bring fresh scents to the fragrance and ittar industry. This endeavor challenges me to balance my technological expertise with my developing business acumen, offering an exciting landscape for continual growth.

Grounded in the belief that learning is a ceaseless journey, I strive to diversify my interests and skillset. Let's connect, share, and evolve together in this incredible professional voyage!
